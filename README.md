# MPU-9250
9 Axis Sensor Module I2C SPI

This MPU9250 module houses a 3-Axis gyroscope, accelerometer, magnetometer and embedded temperature sensor. The module includes pull-up resistors on the SDA, SCL, and nCS lines, pull-down resistors on the FSYNC and AD0 lines, and an on-board 3.3V voltage regulator allowing you to power the module from 5V sources such as an Arduino. If you desire to power the module from 3.3V you can bridge the solder jumper next to the voltage regulator to bypass the regulator.
